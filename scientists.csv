Aaronson,7,"Aaronson grew up in the United States, though he spent a year in Asia when his father—a science writer turned public-relations executive—was posted to Hong Kong.[6] He enrolled in a school there that permitted him to skip ahead several years in math, but upon returning to the US, he found his education restrictive, getting bad grades and having run-ins with teachers. He enrolled in The Clarkson School, a gifted education program run by Clarkson University, which enabled Aaronson to apply for colleges while only in his freshman year of high school.[6] He was accepted into Cornell University, where he obtained his BSc in computer science in 2000,[7] and where he resided at the Telluride House.[8] He then attended the University of California, Berkeley, for his PhD, which he got in 2004 under the supervision of Umesh Vazirani.[9] Aaronson had shown ability in mathematics from an early age, teaching himself calculus at the age of 11, provoked by symbols in a babysitter's textbook. He discovered computer programming at age 11, and felt he lagged behind peers, who had already been coding for years. In part due to Aaronson getting into advanced mathematics before getting into computer programming, he felt drawn to theoretical computing, particularly computational complexity theory. At Cornell, he became interested in quantum computing and devoted himself to computational complexity and quantum computing.[6]",230

For related reasons, his mother had to leave her job. For the next eight months, without any steady income, they were forced to take on temporary jobs as they waited, afraid their request would be denied as it was for many refuseniks. In May 1979, they were granted their official exit visas and were allowed to leave the country.[7] The Brin family lived in Vienna and Paris while Mikhail Brin secured a teaching position at the University of Maryland with help from Anatole Katok. During this time, the Brin family received support and assistance from the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society. They arrived in the United States on October 25, 1979.[7][9] Brin attended elementary school at Paint Branch Montessori School in Adelphi, Maryland, but he received further education at home; his father, a professor in the department of mathematics at the University of Maryland, encouraged him to learn mathematics and his family helped him retain his Russian-language skills.

Hansen,6,"Per Brinch Hansen was born in Frederiksberg, an enclave surrounded by Copenhagen, Denmark. His father, Jørgen Brinch Hansen, worked as a civil engineer, becoming a leading expert in soil mechanics, and later accepting a professorship at Technical University of Denmark. His mother, Elsebeth Brinch Hansen (née Ring), was the daughter of Danish composer Oluf Ring and worked as a hairdresser before marrying.[1] Brinch Hansen attended Skt. Jørgens Gymnasium and then studied electrical engineering at Technical University of Denmark where he sought an area to pursue that ""was still in its pioneering phase"" on the belief that ""If a subject was being taught, it was probably already too late to make fundamental contributions.""[1][2] After a seven-week student internship at IBM's Hursley Laboratory in England, he decided to dedicate his career to computers. Initially focused on computer construction, reading a book on the IBM 7030 Stretch project that described computer organization from a programmer's point of view[3] refocused his interest toward becoming a computer architect.[1] After completing a Master of Science degree in electronic engineering in 1963, Brinch Hansen landed a job at Regnecentralen, then a research institution under The Danish Academy of Technical Sciences (Akademiet for de Tekniske Videnskaber), working in the compiler group, led by Peter Naur and Jørn Jensen.[2] There, his first significant project was writing a parser for a COBOL compiler for the Siemens 3003 computer. Subsequently, he wrote a file system to be used during execution of the compiled COBOL programs, later observing:[1] I now understand that it was really a small operating system, I had programmed. However, in the mid 1960s, the dividing line between language implementation and operating systems was still not clearly understood. In 1966, Brinch Hansen moved to Henning Isaksson's hardware group at Regnecentralen, by then a company with shareholders. Together with Peter Kraft, he defined the computer architecture and instruction set for Regnecentralen's third computer, the RC 4000, using ALGOL 60 as a hardware description language to produce a formal specification. Inexperienced with multiprogramming, he used a copy of Cooperating Sequential Processes[4] Edsger Dijkstra had sent him to understand process synchronization using semaphores, and then implemented a specialized RC 4000 real-time monitor for use in managing a fertilizer plant. Peter Kraft and Charles Simonyi, who was still a teenager, wrote a p-code interpreter and data logging task programs that were compiled to p-code.[1] In the summer of 1967, Brinch Hansen left Regnecentralen's hardware group to become head of RC 4000 software development, where he led a team including Jørn Jensen, Peter Kraft and Søren Lauesen in defining a general-purpose RC 4000 multiprogramming system, with a goal to avoid developing a custom real-time control operating system for every RC 4000 installation, and to support batch processing and time-sharing as well.[1] The resulting system was not a complete operating system, but a small kernel providing the mechanisms upon which operating systems for different purposes could be built.[5] By the spring of 1969, a well-documented, reliable version of the RC 4000 multiprogramming system was running.[1] In late 1970, Brinch Hansen moved to Pittsburgh, accepting an invitation from Alan Perlis to visit the department of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University as a research associate, while he wrote the first systematic textbook on operating system principles.[1][2] During this time, at the 1971 Summer School in Marktoberdorf and a symposium in Belfast, Brinch Hansen, Tony Hoare and Dijkstra began to discuss ideas that evolved into the monitor concept. In the spring of 1972, after reading about the class concept invented by Ole-Johan Dahl and Kristen Nygaard for Simula 67, Brinch Hansen completed his text with a chapter on resource protection that proposed the first monitor notation, using shared classes.[6] In 1973, Operating System Principles was published, becoming the first comprehensive textbook on operating systems.[7] In July 1972, Brinch Hansen joined the faculty of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) as an Associate Professor of computer science, where he began work on defining a programming language with concurrent processes and monitors. In April 1974, he distributed a technical report on Concurrent Pascal.[1][2] A Concurrent Pascal compiler for the PDP 11/45, written by Brinch Hansen's doctoral student, Al Hartmann, was released in January 1975.[8] Subsequently, Brinch Hansen began writing model operating systems in Concurrent Pascal, to evaluate the language. In May 1975, he completed Solo, a single-user operating system for development of Concurrent Pascal programs. Next, he rewrote the original RC 4000 real-time scheduler in Concurrent Pascal, taking three days to write it, and three hours of machine time to systematically test it.[6] When the Caltech computer science department shifted focus toward computer engineering and away from programming Brinch Hansen decided to leave, rather than to seek tenure there.[1] In 1976, Brinch Hansen chose University of Southern California (USC) for his next post, so that his family could remain in their Altadena home. Joining the faculty as a tenured full professor, and first chair of a newly created computer science department, he led efforts to identify and attract top-notch faculty to build a first rate department. By 1980, USC's computer science department was ranked by the National Research Council as one of the top ten in the US.[1] While at USC, Brinch Hansen wrote his second book, The Architecture of Concurrent Programs, based on his work developing operating systems with Concurrent Pascal.[2] Published in 1977, it was the first book on concurrent programming.[9] In 1978, Brinch Hansen became the first computer scientist awarded the Doctor Technices degree, the highest academic distinction within engineering and technological science in Denmark,[10] for the work documented in The Architecture of Concurrent Programs. Later in 1978, Brinch Hansen published the Distributed Processes language concept, proposing the use of remote procedure calls to synchronize processes running across a microcomputer network.[11] Also in 1978, L. J. Sevins and Steve Goings from Mostek visited Brinch Hansen at USC, where he outlined a low-cost multiprocessor architecture. Mostek began a project to implement such a multiprocessor, with Brinch Hansen working as a consultant.[1] Brinch Hansen developed a new concurrent programming language, Edison, for the project.[12] As with the RC 4000 project, Edison was also used as a formal specification language for the hardware. Mostek got an initial 4-node multiprocessor working and Brinch Hansen wrote a portable Edison compiler on a PDP 11/55, but shortly after, United Technologies acquired Mostek[13] and cancelled the project. In 1982, Brinch Hansen moved the Edison system to an IBM Personal Computer (PC), and then published his third book, Programming a Personal Computer.[14] In 1982, Brinch Hansen was named the first Henry Salvatori Professor of Computer Science at USC.[1] In 1984, feeling homesick for Denmark after 14 years abroad, Brinch Hansen left USC and joined the faculty of the University of Copenhagen as a Professor of datalogy.[1] In 1985, he was elected a Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).[15] Later in 1985, his fourth book Brinch Hansen on Pascal Compilers, which he used for his own compiler course, was published.[16] While designing a multicomputer operating system for Danish company GN Elmi, Brinch Hansen concluded he needed a new language, this time leveraging the message passing paradigm of Hoare's CSP.[1] The resulting language, Joyce, removed a major limitation of CSP by introducing parallel recursion.[17] Brinch Hansen developed a portable implementation on an IBM PC.[1] After finding that neither he nor his family felt at home in Denmark, Brinch Hansen decided to return to the US, but discovered that their immigration status required them to do so very quickly. Brinch Hansen contacted John Reynolds at Syracuse University and in 1987 he joined the faculty as a Distinguished Professor.[1] Working with his student Rangachari Anand, Joyce was moved to an Encore Multimax 320 multiprocessor at SU's Northeast Parallel Architectures Center. Recognizing the scaling limitations of multiprocessors, however, Brinch Hansen sought a suitable multicomputer for further work. Acquiring a Meiko Computing Surface in 1989, he began experimenting with scientific applications by developing parallel programs for Householder's method (reduction) and then n-body simulation as learning exercises, and was surprised to find that both programs had nearly identical control structures. Concluding that both fit an ""all-pairs paradigm,"" he then focused on exploring reusable parallel algorithm structures he termed ""programming paradigms"" or ""generic programs"" (later, popularly known as ""design patterns"").[1] In 1995, Brinch Hansen's fifth book, Studies in Computational Science: Parallel Programming Paradigms was published,[18] with programs rewritten in SuperPascal, a fully implemented publication language he created for parallel algorithms.[19] In his later years, Brinch Hansen published a retrospective of his most important papers, The Search for Simplicity (1996),[20] a text for a course in programming for non-majors, Programming for Everyone in Java (1999),[21] a retrospective on the evolution of operating systems, Classic Operating Systems: From Batch Processing to Distributed Systems (2001),[22] and a retrospective on the evolution of concurrent programming, The Origin of Concurrent Programming: From Semaphores to Remote Procedure Calls (2002).[23] He self-published a 2004 memoir, A Programmer's Story: The Life of a Computer Pioneer, on his website.[1] In 2002, Brinch Hansen was awarded the IEEE Computer Pioneer Award ""For pioneering development in operating systems and concurrent programming exemplified by work on the RC 4000 multiprogramming system, monitors, and Concurrent Pascal.""[15] On July 31, 2007, Brinch Hansen died, shortly after being diagnosed with terminal cancer.[24]",55

Before the civil rights movement, education for black communities was extremely limited. Segregation was prevalent everywhere in society and black children were not offered the same opportunities as white children. Inspired by her mother to follow her dreams, set goals and work hard at them, Easley dedicated herself to her studies. She graduated valedictorian of Holy Family High School and enrolled in Xavier University in New Orleans. Four years later she got married and moved to Cleveland where she would continue to puruse a career in pharmaceuticals which would prove improbable. The next year, she divorced and moved back to Birmingham to be near her family. Being recently divorced and out of work after recently moving back home, Annie was constanlty on the search for work. However, Jim Crow laws were still in place during this time and black people were required to take literacy tests and pay poll taxes. Easley would help many members of her community to pass these tests and receive ultimately find jobs. Before the Civil Rights Movement, educational and career opportunities for African-American children were very limited. Segregation was prevalent, African-American children were educated separately from white children, and their schools were often inferior to white schools. Annie's mother told her that she could be anything, but she would have to work at it. She encouraged Annie to get a good education.

Fredkin,1,"Fredkin's mother and father were both Russian immigrants who met in Los Angeles, and he was the youngest child of four. His mother was a concert pianist, although she did not perform professionally. She died from cancer when he was 11. His father was a businessperson but had lost everything in the 1929 stock market crash and as a result, the family was relatively poor. At times he lived with other families or with his older sister. Eventually, his father remarried, and he and his sister moved back in. As a child, he was both entrepreneurial and interested in science and how things work. He did various weekend and after-school things to earn money, eventually handling a large newspaper delivery route. At age 10 he bought chemistry supplies and made his own fireworks, which were then illegal in Los Angeles. He did poorly in school because he didn't do homework. He graduated from John Marshall High School a semester early so that he could earn money for Caltech tuition and living expenses. Caltech later told him he had been admitted with the worst high school grades they had ever seen. He quit Caltech partway through his sophomore year.[4] In 1952, he joined the United States Air Force (USAF) to become a fighter pilot avoid being drafted into the Korean War.[5] His computer career started in 1956 when the Air Force assigned him to MIT Lincoln Laboratory where he worked on the SAGE computer.[6]",8

Gates,5,"William Henry Gates III was born on October 28, 1955, in Seattle, Washington[13]as the only son of William H. Gates Sr.[b] (1925–2020) and his first wife, Mary Maxwell Gates (1929–1994).[14] His ancestry includes English, German, and Irish/Scots-Irish.[15] His father was a prominent lawyer, and his mother served on the board of directors of First Interstate BancSystem and United Way of America. Gates's maternal grandfather was J. W. Maxwell, a national bank president. He also has an older sister Kristi (Kristianne) and a younger sister Libby. He is the fourth of his name in his family but is known as William Gates III or ""Trey"" (i.e., three) because his father had the ""II"" suffix.[16][17] The family lived in the Sand Point area of Seattle in a home that was damaged by a rare tornado when Gates was seven years old.[18] According to Gates, when he was young, his parents wanted him to pursue a career in law.[19] During his childhood, his family regularly attended a church of the Congregational Christian Churches, a Protestant Reformed denomination.[20][21][22] Gates was small for his age and was bullied as a child.[17] The family encouraged competition; one visitor reported that ""it didn't matter whether it was hearts or pickleball or swimming to the dock; there was always a reward for winning and there was always a penalty for losing"".[23] At age 13, he enrolled in the private Lakeside prep school,[24][25] where he wrote his first software program.[26] When he was in eighth grade, the Mothers' Club at the school used proceeds from Lakeside School's rummage sale to buy a Teletype Model 33 ASR terminal and a block of computer time on a General Electric (GE) computer for the students.[27] Gates took an interest in programming the GE system in BASIC, and he was excused from math classes to pursue his interest. He wrote his first computer program on this machine, an implementation of tic-tac-toe that allowed users to play games against the computer. Gates was fascinated by the machine and how it would always execute software code perfectly.[28] After the Mothers Club donation was exhausted, Gates and other students sought time on systems including DEC PDP minicomputers. One of these systems was a PDP-10 belonging to Computer Center Corporation (CCC) which banned Gates, Paul Allen, Ric Weiland, and Gates's best friend and first business partner Kent Evans for the summer after it caught them exploiting bugs in the operating system to obtain free computer time.[29][17] The four students formed the Lakeside Programmers Club to make money.[17] At the end of the ban, they offered to find bugs in CCC's software in exchange for extra computer time. Rather than using the system remotely via Teletype, Gates went to CCC's offices and studied source code for various programs that ran on the system, including Fortran, Lisp, and machine language. The arrangement with CCC continued until 1970 when the company went out of business. The following year, a Lakeside teacher enlisted Gates and Evans to automate the school's class-scheduling system, providing them computer time and royalties in return. The duo worked diligently in order to have the program ready for their senior year. Towards the end of their junior year, Evans was killed in a mountain climbing accident, which Gates has described as one of the saddest days of his life. Gates then turned to Allen who helped him finish the system for Lakeside.[17] At 17, Gates formed a venture with Allen called Traf-O-Data to make traffic counters based on the Intel 8008 processor.[30] In 1972, he served as a congressional page in the House of Representatives.[31][32] He was a National Merit Scholar when he graduated from Lakeside School in 1973.[33] He scored 1590 out of 1600 on the Scholastic Aptitude Tests (SAT) and enrolled at Harvard College in the autumn of 1973.[34][35] He didn't stay at Harvard long enough to choose a concentration, but took mathematics (including Math 55) and graduate level computer science courses.[36] While at Harvard, he met fellow student and future Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer. Gates left Harvard after two years while Ballmer stayed and graduated magna cum laude. Years later, Ballmer succeeded Gates as Microsoft's CEO and maintained that position from 2000 until his resignation in 2014.[37][38] Gates devised an algorithm for pancake sorting as a solution to one of a series of unsolved problems[39] presented in a combinatorics class by professor Harry Lewis. His solution held the record as the fastest version for over 30 years, and its successor is faster by only 2%.[39][40] His solution was formalized and published in collaboration with Harvard computer scientist Christos Papadimitriou.[41] Gates remained in contact with Paul Allen and joined him at Honeywell during the summer of 1974.[42] In 1975, the MITS Altair 8800 was released based on the Intel 8080 CPU, and Gates and Allen saw the opportunity to start their own computer software company.[43] Gates dropped out of Harvard that same year. His parents were supportive of him after seeing how much he wanted to start his own company.[44] He explained his decision to leave Harvard: ""if things hadn't worked out, I could always go back to school. I was officially on leave.""[45]",3

Gödel,2,"Gödel was born April 28, 1906, in Brünn, Austria-Hungary (now Brno, Czech Republic), into the German-speaking family of Rudolf Gödel (1874–1929), the managing director and part owner of a major textile firm, and Marianne Gödel (née Handschuh, 1879–1966).[6] At the time of his birth the city had a German-speaking majority which included his parents.[7] His father was Catholic and his mother was Protestant and the children were raised as Protestants. The ancestors of Kurt Gödel were often active in Brünn's cultural life. For example, his grandfather Joseph Gödel was a famous singer in his time and for some years a member of the Brünner Männergesangverein (Men's Choral Union of Brünn).[8] Gödel automatically became a citizen of Czechoslovakia at age 12 when the Austro-Hungarian Empire collapsed following its defeat in the First World War. According to his classmate Klepetař, like many residents of the predominantly German Sudetenländer, ""Gödel considered himself always Austrian and an exile in Czechoslovakia"".[9] In February 1929, he was granted release from his Czechoslovak citizenship and then, in April, granted Austrian citizenship.[10] When Germany annexed Austria in 1938, Gödel automatically became a German citizen at age 32. In 1948, after World War II, at the age of 42, he became an American citizen.[11] In his family, the young Gödel was nicknamed Herr Warum (""Mr. Why"") because of his insatiable curiosity. According to his brother Rudolf, at the age of six or seven, Kurt suffered from rheumatic fever; he completely recovered, but for the rest of his life he remained convinced that his heart had suffered permanent damage. Beginning at age four, Gödel suffered from ""frequent episodes of poor health"", which would continue for his entire life.[12] Gödel attended the Evangelische Volksschule, a Lutheran school in Brünn from 1912 to 1916, and was enrolled in the Deutsches Staats-Realgymnasium from 1916 to 1924, excelling with honors in all his subjects, particularly in mathematics, languages and religion. Although Gödel had first excelled in languages, he later became more interested in history and mathematics. His interest in mathematics increased when in 1920 his older brother Rudolf (born 1902) left for Vienna, where he attended medical school at the University of Vienna. During his teens, Gödel studied Gabelsberger shorthand,[13] and criticisms of Isaac Newton, and the writings of Immanuel Kant.[14] At the age of 18, Gödel joined his brother at the University of Vienna. He had already mastered university-level mathematics.[15] Although initially intending to study theoretical physics, he also attended courses on mathematics and philosophy.[16] During this time, he adopted ideas of mathematical realism. He read Kant's Metaphysische Anfangsgründe der Naturwissenschaft, and participated in the Vienna Circle with Moritz Schlick, Hans Hahn, and Rudolf Carnap. Gödel then studied number theory, but when he took part in a seminar run by Moritz Schlick which studied Bertrand Russell's book Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy, he became interested in mathematical logic. According to Gödel, mathematical logic was ""a science prior to all others, which contains the ideas and principles underlying all sciences.""[17] Attending a lecture by David Hilbert in Bologna on completeness and consistency in mathematical systems may have set Gödel's life course. In 1928, Hilbert and Wilhelm Ackermann published Grundzüge der theoretischen Logik (Principles of Mathematical Logic), an introduction to first-order logic in which the problem of completeness was posed: ""Are the axioms of a formal system sufficient to derive every statement that is true in all models of the system?""[18] This problem became the topic that Gödel chose for his doctoral work.[18] In 1929, aged 23, he completed his doctoral dissertation under Hans Hahn's supervision. In it, he established his eponymous completeness theorem regarding first-order logic.[18] He was awarded his doctorate in 1930,[18] and his thesis (accompanied by additional work) was published by the Vienna Academy of Science.",0

Hopper,2,"Grace Brewster Murray was born in New York City. She was the eldest of three children. Her parents, Walter Fletcher Murray and Mary Campbell Van Horne, were of Scottish and Dutch descent, and attended West End Collegiate Church.[8] Her great-grandfather, Alexander Wilson Russell, an admiral in the US Navy, fought in the Battle of Mobile Bay during the Civil War.[8]: 2–3 Grace was very curious as a child; this was a lifelong trait. At the age of seven, she decided to determine how an alarm clock worked and dismantled seven alarm clocks before her mother realized what she was doing (she was then limited to one clock).[9] Later in life, she was known for keeping a clock that ran backward, she explained, ""Humans are allergic to change. They love to say, 'We've always done it this way.' I try to fight that. That's why I have a clock on my wall that runs counterclockwise.""[10] For her preparatory school education, she attended the Hartridge School in Plainfield, New Jersey. Grace was initially rejected for early admission to Vassar College at age 16 (because her test scores in Latin were too low), but she was admitted the following year. She graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Vassar in 1928 with a bachelor's degree in mathematics and physics and earned her master's degree at Yale University in 1930. In 1930, Grace Murray married New York University professor Vincent Foster Hopper (1906–1976); they divorced in 1945.[11][12] She did not marry again and retained his surname. In 1934, Hopper earned a Ph.D. in mathematics from Yale[13] under the direction of Øystein Ore.[11][14] Her dissertation, ""New Types of Irreducibility Criteria"",[15] was published that same year.[16] She began teaching mathematics at Vassar in 1931, and was promoted to associate professor in 1941.[17]",0

Hui,0,"Hui was born in Hong Kong in 1953. In 1966, he immigrated to Canada with his entire family.[3] In 1973, Hui entered the University of Alberta. In his second year he took a course on probability and statistics in which students were expected to learn the programming language APL with little or no formal instruction. He used all the time he could muster on a heavily burdened computer, and benefited from the APL\360 User's Manual (the book APL Language was not published until March 1975). Because the manual was written by Adin Falkoff and Kenneth E. Iverson, Hui thought it reasonable to say he learned APL from Falkoff and Iverson. As a summer student in 1975 and 1976, Hui worked at I. P. Sharp Associates (IPSA) in Calgary, on workspaces for statistical and probability calculations. The major attraction of the job was the unrestricted computer time with access to APL. After receiving a BSc degree with first class honors in computer science in 1977, Hui worked for two years as a full-time programmer and analyst in the new Edmonton office of IPSA, where his main duty was to support clients in their use of APL time-sharing. He attended the APL79 conference in Rochester, New York, where Iverson gave two papers: ""The Role of Operators in APL"" and ""The Derivative Operator"". On the way, Hui stopped at IPSA in Toronto and obtained a copy of ""Operators and Functions"" [IBM Research Report No. 7091, 1978]. He has been studying that paper and its successors ever since.[citation needed] In September 1979, Hui entered the Department of Computer Science at the University of Toronto, and received his MSc in May 1981 with a thesis on ""The complexity of some decompositions in matrix algebra.""[4] After completing his master's degree, Hui worked from 1981 to 1985 as an APL systems analyst and programmer for the Alberta Energy Company in Edmonton. In February 1982 Hui purchased A Source Book in APL (1981), in which the most memorable papers were ""The Design of APL"" (1973), ""The Evolution of APL"" (1978), and ""Notation as a Tool of Thought"" (1980). Hui's work was described at the APL85 conference in a paper, ""DESIGN: A Financial Modelling System"", written jointly with his supervisor, Fred Appleyard. The basic objects in the system were in ""Direct Definition"" (Iverson, 1976, 1980), and Falkoff and Iverson's The Design of APL was cited. Hui left Alberta Energy shortly after being promoted to a non-APL and non-programming position, and was out of work, and had no access to computers, from September 1985 to April 1986. This gave him plenty of time for intense study of Iverson's Rationalized APL (1983) and A Dictionary of the APL Language, as it was then named. Hui and his wife Stella had two children.  He died on October 16, 2021, from cancer.[5]",0

Iverson,2,"Iverson began school on 1 April 1926 in a one-room school,[4] initially in Grade 1, promoted to Grade 2 after 3 months and to Grade 4 by the end of June 1927.
He left school after Grade 9 because it was the depths of the Great Depression and there was work to do on the family farm, and because he thought further schooling only led to becoming a schoolteacher and he had no desire to become one.  At age 17, while still out of school, he enrolled in a correspondence course on radios with De Forest Training in Chicago, and learned calculus by self-study from a textbook.[4][6]
During World War II, while serving in the Royal Canadian Air Force, he took correspondence courses toward a high school diploma. After the war, Iverson enrolled in Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, taking advantage of government support for ex-servicemen and under threat from an Air Force buddy who said he would ""beat his brains out if he did not grasp the opportunity"".[4] He graduated in 1950 as the top student with a Bachelor's degree in mathematics and physics.[3] Continuing his education at Harvard University, he began in the Department of Mathematics and received a Master's degree in 1951.  He then switched to the Department of Engineering and Applied Physics, working with Howard Aiken and Wassily Leontief. Kenneth Iverson has recalled graduate study under Aiken as ""like an apprenticeship"" in which the student ""learned the tools of the scholarship trade"". Every topic was ""used more as a focus for the development of skills such as clarity of thought and expression than as an end in itself"". Once admitted to the program, a graduate student underwent a rite of ""adoption into the fold"". He was given a desk (or a share of a desk) among a group of other graduate students, the permanent staff, or visiting scholars, ""most of whom were engaged in some aspect of the design and building of computers"". A student was thus ""made to feel part of a scholarly enterprise"" and was provided, ""often for the first time, with easy and intimate access to others more experienced in his chosen field"". When interviewing Aiken, I had asked him whether Tropp and I might see his lecture notes; Aiken replied that he had always destroyed his lecture notes at the end of each year, so that he would not be tempted to repeat his lectures. Howard Aiken had developed the Harvard Mark I, one of the first large-scale digital computers, while Wassily Leontief was an economist who was developing the input–output model of economic analysis, work for which he would later receive the Nobel prize. Leontief's model required large matrices and Iverson worked on programs that could evaluate these matrices on the Harvard Mark IV computer. Iverson received a Ph.D. in applied mathematics in 1954 with a dissertation based on this work.[9][10] At Harvard, Iverson met Eoin Whitney, a 2-time Putnam Fellow and fellow graduate student from Alberta.[11][12]  This had future ramifications.",45

After reading the computer's manual, Knuth decided to rewrite the assembly and compiler code for the machine used in his school because he believed he could do it better.[11] In 1958, Knuth created a program to help his school's basketball team win its games.[12] He assigned ""values"" to players in order to gauge their probability of scoring points, a novel approach that Newsweek and CBS Evening News later reported on.[11] Knuth was one of the founding editors of the Case Institute's Engineering and Science Review, which won a national award as best technical magazine in 1959.[13][14] He then switched from physics to mathematics, and received two degrees from Case in 1960:[10] his Bachelor of Science, and simultaneously a master of science by a special award of the faculty, who considered his work exceptionally outstanding.[4][11] In 1963, with mathematician Marshall Hall as his adviser,[2] he earned a PhD in mathematics from the California Institute of Technology, with a thesis titled Finite Semifields and Projective Planes.[15] In 1963, after receiving his PhD, Knuth joined Caltech's faculty as an assistant professor.[16] Knuth accepted a commission to write a book on computer programming language compilers. While working on this project, he decided that he could not adequately treat the topic without first developing a fundamental theory of computer programming, which became The Art of Computer Programming. He originally planned to publish this as a single book, but as he developed his outline for the book, he concluded that he required six volumes, and then seven, to thoroughly cover the subject. He published the first volume in 1968.[17] Just before publishing the first volume of The Art of Computer Programming, Knuth left Caltech to accept employment with the Institute for Defense Analyses' Communications Research Division,[18] then situated on the Princeton campus, which was performing mathematical research in cryptography to support the National Security Agency. In 1967, Knuth attended a Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics conference and someone asked what he did. At the time, computer science was partitioned into numerical analysis, artificial intelligence, and programming languages. Based on his study and The Art of Computer Programming book, Knuth decided the next time someone asked he would say, ""Analysis of algorithms"".[19] In 1969, Knuth left his position at Princeton to join the Stanford University faculty,[20] where he became Fletcher Jones Professor of Computer Science in 1977.

He graduated with bachelor's degrees in Mathematics and Physics, and a master's degree in Applied Mathematics, all in 1972.[14] For his senior thesis, advised in part by Dennis Gabor, was to bounce acoustic waves in the 40 mHz range off real-world objects, record their interference patterns on a 2-meter square plot, photo-reduce those to a 10-mm square film image, shine a laser through the film, and thus project the three-dimensional imaged object—i.e., the first known acoustic hologram.[citation needed] To settle an argument with Dr. Gabor, Lenat computer-generated a five-dimensional hologram, by photo-reducing computer printout of the interference pattern of a globe rotating and expanding over time, reducing the large two-dimensional paper printout to a moderately large 5-cm square film surface through which a conventional laser beam was then able to project a three-dimensional image, which changed in two independent ways (rotating and changing in size) as the film was moved up-down or left-right.[citation needed] Lenat was a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Stanford University, where his published research included automatic program synthesis from input/output pairs and from natural language clarification dialogues.[15]",0

Lerdorf,0,"Lerdorf was born on Disko Island in Greenland and moved to Denmark in his early years.[2] Lerdorf's family moved to Canada from Denmark in 1980, and later moved to King City, Ontario in 1983.[3] He graduated from King City Secondary School in 1988, and in 1993 he graduated from the University of Waterloo with a Bachelor of Applied Science in Systems Design Engineering. He contributed to the Apache HTTP Server and he added the LIMIT clause to the mSQL DBMS. A variant of this LIMIT clause had already been around for a decade in mainframe relational database management systems (like Oracle Rdb running on VMS, formerly from Digital Equipment Corporation), but apparently it had not yet been picked up by the emerging PC-based databases. It was later adapted by several other SQL-compatible DBMS.[4][5] He released the first version of PHP in 1995.[6]",5

Liedtke,0,"In the mid-1970s Liedtke studied for a diploma degree in mathematics at the Bielefeld University. His thesis project was to build a compiler for the programming language ELAN, which had been launched for teaching programming in German schools.[citation needed] The compiler was written in ELAN. After his graduation in 1977, he remained at Bielefeld and worked on an Elan environment for the Zilog Z80 microprocessor. This required a runtime system (environment), which he named Eumel (""Extendable Multiuser Microprocessor ELAN-System"", but also a colloquial north-German term for a likeable fool). Eumel grew into a complete multi-tasking, multi-user operating system supporting orthogonal persistence, which started shipping (by whom? to whom?) in 1980 and was later ported to Zilog Z8000, Motorola 68000 and Intel 8086 processors. As these processors lacked memory protection, Eumel implemented a virtual machine which added the features missing from the hardware.[1] More than 2000 Eumel systems shipped, mostly to schools, and some to legal practices as a text processing platform. In 1984, he joined the Gesellschaft für Mathematik und Datenverarbeitung (GMD), the German National Research Center for Computer Science, which is now a part of the Fraunhofer Society. There, he continued his work on Eumel. In 1987, when microprocessors supporting virtual memory became widely available in the form of the Intel 80386, Liedtke started to design a new operating system to succeed Eumel, which he called L3 (""Liedtke's 3rd system"", after Eumel and the ALGOL 60 interpreter he had written in high school). L3 was designed to achieve better performance by using the latest hardware features, and was implemented from scratch. It was mostly backward-compatible with Eumel, thus benefiting from the existing Eumel ecosystem. L3 started to ship in 1989, with total deployment of at least 500.[1] Both Eumel and L3 were microkernel systems, a popular design in the 1980s. However, by the early 1990s, microkernels had received a bad reputation, as systems built on top were performing poorly, culminating in the billion-dollar failure of the IBM Workplace OS. The reason was claimed to be inherent in the operating-system structure imposed by microkernels.[2] Liedtke, however, observed that the message-passing operation (IPC), which is fundamentally important for microkernel performance, was slow in all existing microkernels, including his own L3 system.[3] His conclusion was that radical redesign was needed. He did this by re-implementing L3 from scratch, dramatically simplifying the kernel, resulting in an order-of-magnitude decrease in IPC cost.[4]
The resulting kernel was later renamed ""L4"". Conceptually, the main novelty of L4 was its complete reliance on external pagers (page fault handlers), and the recursive construction of address spaces.[5]
This led to a complete family of microkernels, with many independent implementations of the same principles. Liedtke also worked on computer architecture, inventing guarded page tables as a means to implement a sparsely-mapped 64-bit address space.[6] In 1996, Liedtke completed a PhD on guarded page tables at the Technical University of Berlin. In the same year he joined the Thomas J. Watson Research Center, where he continued to work on L4, referred to as “Lava Nucleus” (LN) to avoid negative connotations with previously unsuccessful microkernels, such as the one used in Workplace OS. The main project during his IBM time was the Saw Mill project, which attempted to turn Linux into an L4-based multi-server OS. In April 1999, he took up the System Architecture Chair at the University of Karlsruhe. There, he continued to collaborate with IBM on Saw Mill, but at the same time worked on a new generation of L4 (version 4). Several experimental kernels were developed during that time, including Hazelnut, the first L4 kernel that was ported (in contrast to re-implemented) to a different architecture (from x86 to ARM). Work on the new version was completed after his death by Liedtke's students Volkmar Uhlig, Uwe Dannowski, and Espen Skoglund. It was released under the name Pistachio in 2002. On Sunday June 10, 2001, he died unexpectedly at Frankfurt Airport while returning from SOSP'01 program committee meeting in Chateau Lake Louise, having been ill earlier in the year and undergone two surgeries (the conference proceedings were dedicated to his memory).[7] He is survived by his wife Adelheid.",37

Lovelace,19,"From 1832, when she was seventeen, her mathematical abilities began to emerge,[23] and her interest in mathematics dominated the majority of her adult life.[39] Her mother's obsession with rooting out any of the insanity of which she accused Byron was one of the reasons that Ada was taught mathematics from an early age. She was privately educated in mathematics and science by William Frend, William King,[a] and Mary Somerville, the noted 19th-century researcher and scientific author. In the 1840s, the mathematician Augustus De Morgan extended her ""much help in her mathematical studies"" including study of advanced calculus topics including the ""numbers of Bernoulli"" (that formed her celebrated algorithm for Babbage's Analytical Engine).[40] In a letter to Lady Byron, De Morgan suggested that Ada's skill in mathematics might lead her to become ""an original mathematical investigator, perhaps of first-rate eminence"".[41] Lovelace often questioned basic assumptions through integrating poetry and science. Whilst studying differential calculus, she wrote to De Morgan: I may remark that the curious transformations many formulae can undergo, the unsuspected and to a beginner apparently impossible identity of forms exceedingly dissimilar at first sight, is I think one of the chief difficulties in the early part of mathematical studies. I am often reminded of certain sprites and fairies one reads of, who are at one's elbows in one shape now, and the next minute in a form most dissimilar.[42] Lovelace believed that intuition and imagination were critical to effectively applying mathematical and scientific concepts. She valued metaphysics as much as mathematics, viewing both as tools for exploring ""the unseen worlds around us"".[43] Lovelace died at the age of 36 on 27 November 1852,[44] from uterine cancer.[45] The illness lasted several months, in which time Annabella took command over whom Ada saw, and excluded all of her friends and confidants. Under her mother's influence, Ada had a religious transformation and was coaxed into repenting of her previous conduct and making Annabella her executor.[46] She lost contact with her husband after confessing something to him on 30 August which caused him to abandon her bedside. It is not known what she told him.[47] She was buried, at her request, next to her father at the Church of St. Mary Magdalene in Hucknall, Nottinghamshire. A memorial plaque, written in Latin, to her and her father is in the chapel attached to Horsley Towers.[citation needed]",0

Neumann,1,"Von Neumann was born in Budapest, Kingdom of Hungary (then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire),[13][14][15] on December 28, 1903, to a wealthy, non-observant Jewish family. His birth name was Neumann János Lajos. In Hungarian, the family name comes first, and his given names are equivalent to John Louis in English.[16] He was the eldest of three brothers; his two younger siblings were Mihály (Michael) and Miklós (Nicholas).[17] His father Neumann Miksa (Max von Neumann) was a banker and held a doctorate in law. He had moved to Budapest from Pécs at the end of the 1880s.[18] Miksa's father and grandfather were born in Ond (now part of Szerencs), Zemplén County, northern Hungary. John's mother was Kann Margit (English: Margaret Kann);[19] her parents were Jakab Kann and Katalin Meisels of the Meisels family.[20] Three generations of the Kann family lived in spacious apartments above the Kann-Heller offices in Budapest; von Neumann's family occupied an 18-room apartment on the top floor.[21] On February 20, 1913, Emperor Franz Joseph elevated John's father to the Hungarian nobility for his service to the Austro-Hungarian Empire.[22] The Neumann family thus acquired the hereditary appellation Margittai, meaning ""of Margitta"" (today Marghita, Romania). The family had no connection with the town; the appellation was chosen in reference to Margaret, as was their chosen coat of arms depicting three marguerites. Neumann János became margittai Neumann János (John Neumann de Margitta), which he later changed to the German Johann von Neumann.[23] Von Neumann was a child prodigy who at six years old could divide two eight-digit numbers in his head[24][25] and converse in Ancient Greek.[26] He, his brothers and his cousins were instructed by governesses. Von Neumann's father believed that knowledge of languages other than their native Hungarian was essential, so the children were tutored in English, French, German and Italian.[27] By age eight, von Neumann was familiar with differential and integral calculus, and by twelve he had read Borel's La Théorie des Fonctions.[28] He was also interested in history, reading Wilhelm Oncken's 46-volume world history series Allgemeine Geschichte in Einzeldarstellungen (General History in Monographs).[29] One of the rooms in the apartment was converted into a library and reading room.[30] Von Neumann entered the Lutheran Fasori Evangélikus Gimnázium in 1914.[31] Eugene Wigner was a year ahead of von Neumann at the school and soon became his friend.[32] Although von Neumann's father insisted that he attend school at the grade level appropriate to his age, he agreed to hire private tutors to give von Neumann advanced instruction. At 15, he began to study advanced calculus under the analyst Gábor Szegő.[32] By 19, von Neumann had published two major mathematical papers, the second of which gave the modern definition of ordinal numbers, which superseded Georg Cantor's definition.[33] At the conclusion of his education at the gymnasium, he applied for and won the Eötvös Prize, a national award for mathematics.[34] According to his friend Theodore von Kármán, von Neumann's father wanted John to follow him into industry, and asked von Kármán to persuade his son not to take mathematics.[35] Von Neumann and his father decided that the best career path was chemical engineering. This was not something that von Neumann had much knowledge of, so it was arranged for him to take a two-year, non-degree course in chemistry at the University of Berlin, after which he sat for the entrance exam to  ETH Zurich,[36] which he passed in September 1923.[37] Simultaneously von Neumann entered Pázmány Péter University in Budapest,[38] as a Ph.D. candidate in mathematics. For his thesis, he produced an axiomatization of Cantor's set theory.[39][40] He graduated as a chemical engineer from ETH Zurich in 1926, and simultaneously passed his final examinations summa cum laude for his Ph.D. in mathematics (with minors in experimental physics and chemistry).[41][42]  He then went to the University of Göttingen on a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation to study mathematics under David Hilbert.[43] Hermann Weyl remembers how in the winter of 1926–1927 von Neumann, Emmy Noether, and he would walk through ""the cold, wet, rain-wet streets of Göttingen"" after class discussing hypercomplex number systems and their representations.[44]",10

Newman,1,"Newman was born Maxwell Herman Alexander Neumann in Chelsea, London, England, to a Jewish family, on 7 February 1897.[4] His father was Herman Alexander Neumann, originally from the German city of Bromberg (now in Poland), who had emigrated with his family to London at the age of 15.[12] Herman worked as a secretary in a company, and married Sarah Ann Pike, an Irish schoolteacher, in 1896.[1] The family moved to Dulwich in 1903, and Newman attended Goodrich Road school, then City of London School from 1908.[1][13] At school, he excelled in classics and in mathematics. He played chess and the piano well.[14] Newman won a scholarship to study mathematics at St John's College, Cambridge in 1915, and in 1916 gained a First in Part I of the Cambridge Mathematical Tripos.[4]",0
Ng,0,"In 2011, Stanford launched a total of three massive open online course (MOOCs) on machine learning (CS229a), databases, and AI, taught by Ng, Peter Norvig, Sebastian Thrun, and Jennifer Widom.[46][47] This has led to the modern MOOC movement. Ng taught machine learning and Widom taught databases. The course on AI taught by Thrun led to the genesis of Udacity.[46] Coursera was the 6th online education website that Ng built and arguably the most successful to date.[48] But we learned and learned and learned from the early prototypes, until in 2011 we managed to build something that really took off.[48] The seeds of massive open online courses (MOOCs) go back a few years before the founding of Coursera in 2012. Two themes emphasized in the founding of modern MOOCs were scale and availability.[46] Ng started the Stanford Engineering Everywhere (SEE) program, which in 2008 published a number of Stanford courses online for free. Ng taught one of these courses, ""Machine Learning"", which includes his video lectures, along with the student materials used in the Stanford CS229 class. It offered a similar experience to MIT OpenCourseWare, except it aimed at providing a more ""complete course"" experience, equipped with lectures, course materials, problems and solutions, etc. The SEE videos were viewed by the millions and inspired Ng to develop and iterate new versions of online tech.[46] Within Stanford, they include Daphne Koller with her ""blended learning experiences"" and codesigning a peer-grading system, John Mitchell (Courseware, a Learning Management System), Dan Boneh (using machine learning to sync videos, later teaching cryptography on Coursera), Bernd Girod (ClassX), and others. Outside Stanford, Ng and Thrun credit Sal Khan of Khan Academy as a huge source of inspiration. Ng was also inspired by lynda.com and the design of the forums of Stack Overflow.[46] Widom, Ng, and others were ardent advocates of Khan-styled tablet recordings, and between 2009 and 2011, several hundred hours of lecture videos recorded by Stanford instructors were recorded and uploaded. Ng tested some of the original designs with a local high school to figure the best practices for recording lessons.[46] In October 2011, the ""applied"" version of the Stanford class (CS229a) was hosted on ml-class.org and launched, with over 100,000 students registered for its first edition. The course featured quizzes and graded programming assignments and became one of the first and most successful massive open online courses (MOOCs) created by a Stanford professor.[49] Two other courses on databases (db-class.org) and AI (ai-class.org) were launched. The ml-class and db-class ran on a platform developed by students, including Frank Chen, Jiquan Ngiam, Chuan-Yu Foo, and Yifan Mai. Word spread through social media and popular press. The three courses were 10 weeks long, and over 40,000 ""Statements of Accomplishment"" were awarded.[46] Ng tells the following story on the early days of Coursera: In 2011, I was working with four Stanford students. We were under tremendous pressure to build new features for the 100,000+ students that were already signed up. One of the students (Frank Chen) claims another one (Jiquan Ngiam) frequently stranded him in the Stanford building and refused to give him a ride back to his dorm until very late at night so he had no choice but to stick around and keep working. I neither confirm nor deny this story.[48] His work subsequently led to his founding of Coursera with Koller in 2012. As of 2019, the two most popular courses on the platform were taught and designed by Ng: ""Machine Learning"" (#1) and ""Neural Networks and Deep Learning"" (#2). In 2019, Ng launched a new course ""AI for Everyone"". This is a non-technical course designed to help people understand AI's impact on society and its benefits and costs for companies, as well as how they can navigate through this technological revolution.[50]",0

Pal,1,"SK Pal studied at the University of Calcutta for his BSc in physics (1969), and BTech (1972) and MTech (1974) in radio physics and electronics. 
He received a PhD in radio physics and electronics from the Rajabazar Science College campus of University of Calcutta in 1979 as a student of Indian Statistical Institute, and another PhD in electrical engineering along with Diploma of the Imperial College from Imperial College, University of London, in 1982. After completing PhD at Imperial College, London as a Commonwealth Scholar, he did post-doctoral research there during 1982 to 1983 as a UK Medical Research Council Fellow. Subsequently, he worked at the University of California, Berkeley and University of Maryland, College Park from 1986 to 1987 as a Fulbright Fellow; NASA Johnson Space Center from 1990 to 1992 and in 1994 as a US NAS-NRC Senior Research Associate; and US Naval Research Laboratory, Washington, D.C. in 2004 as a visiting scientist. Besides, he had been a Distinguished Visitor of IEEE Computer Society (USA) for Asia-Pacific Region since 1997, and held several visiting positions in Australia, Poland, Italy, France, New Zealand, Japan and Hong Kong universities. He established sustained research collaborations in Europe through various European universities including the Warsaw University, Poland (1997-2017); Naples University, Italy (2004-2020) and INSEAD, France (2001-2013), under joint agreements between Nations or Institutes. Pal joined the Indian Statistical Institute (ISI), Kolkata, as a CSIR Senior Research Fellow in 1975, and eventually entered into full professor position in 1987. He then became a distinguished scientist in 1998, the director in 2005, and the president in 2022. He was the first computer scientist as well as someone outside statistics and mathematics to become the director of ISI in its 75-year history. He is also the first ex-employee of ISI being elected to hold the honorable chair of President of ISI since its inception in 1931.[4][5] His areas of research interests include fuzzy sets and uncertainty analysis, artificial neural networks for machine intelligence, pattern recognition, image processing, data mining, granular computing, genetic algorithms, rough sets, and soft computing with applications such as in bioinformatics, video analytics, online social network analysis, and cognitive mind development. He has pioneered hybrid intelligent systems like neuro fuzzy and rough fuzzy hybridization. The generic families of such hybrid intelligent models (networks) developed not only provide enhanced learning, understandability, knowledge mining and uncertainty management in decision-making, but also can explain the network decision in natural language. Besides, rough-fuzzy hybridization enables mining linguistic, categorical, and relational data. All these have led to significant synergistic technological developments in modern AI and data science. His image processing research in 1970s is perhaps the first investigation (other pioneer being A. Rosenfeld, UMD, College Park, USA) that brings out the root relation between the abstract concept of fuzzy sets and image processing tasks & the associated uncertainty involved. Subsequently, definitions for image entropy (mid 1980s) and generalized rough-fuzzy entropy (mid 2000s) based on logarithmic and exponential gain functions are provided for modelling the uncertainty. These measures are unique. Prof. Pal is widely recognized across the world for his pioneering and extraordinary contributions in Machine Intelligence, Fuzzy Logic, Soft Computing and Pattern Recognition. This has made India a leader in these disciplines in international scenario. His other highly cited original/ fundamental research include: i) Unsupervised dimensionality reduction algorithm (in early 2000s) producing maximally independent features, that results in fast and superior performance and is suitable for Big data, ii) Granular computing concept and models particularly when samples are indiscernible; here computations are performed using information granules rather than individual samples, thereby providing gain in both computation and performance in mining tasks, and iii) Z*-number, developed in mid 2010s, for machine subjectivity representation in machine-mind development by encapsulating the objective and subjective time, context, and affect components in natural language of thoughts, speech, and texts. He is a co-author of twenty one books, eighteen conference proceedings, about five hundred and fifty research publications, and two US patents. He has served/serving as editor in most of the well-known scientific journals in computer science and engineering (~25 international journals).[1] He visited more than forty countries as a Keynote/ Invited speaker or academic visitor. He has co-authored with researchers from 48 foreign and 16 Indian institutes. According to Google Scholar, Pal's work had been cited about 37,000 times with h-index of 84. SK Pal is the scientist who introduced the Soft Computing concept and research in India. For his outstanding contributions, the Department of Science and Technology, GoI, established under his leadership the Center for Soft Computing Research (CSCR), first in Asia, in 2004 at ISI, Kolkata. Subsequently, CSCR is declared by the Governing Body of ISI as an Associate Institute of ISI in 2010. Apart from acting as a strong base for nationwide research and training with linkage to industries and premier institutes in India and abroad, CSCR had special provision for funding and mentoring less endowed institutions, including those in North-East regions of India. Machine Intelligence Unit (MIU) founded by him in 1993 at ISI, Kolkata has now turned out to be an internationally recognized leading research school producing many science leaders. These demonstrate his visionary leadership. It is during Pal's directorship of ISI (2005-2010), when the birthday of Prof. P.C. Mahalanobis, the founder of ISI, was declared by the Prime Minister of India on 24 Dec 2006, as the “National Statistics Day” to be celebrated every year over the country. Further, establishing the ISI-Chennai Center, approving the ISI-North Eastern Center, and replacing UGC-pay scales by higher IISc-pay scales for faculty at ISI, are some other major achievements under his visionary leadership as Director of ISI. Biennial International Conference on Pattern Recognition and Machine Intelligence (PReMI), started in 2005, is his another brainchild. This facilitates regular interaction among Indian researchers with international experts in AI, ML and related areas for advancing science & technology. All these activities, including foundation of MIU & CSCR and visionary leadership as ISI-Director, have long lasting educational and societal impact. SK Pal has graduated officially 22 PhD students, so far, in India and abroad. It is not the number, but the quality which was his only concern. Many of his PhDs are now internationally known leading scientists with recognitions like Fellows of IEEE, TWAS, IFSA, INSA, INAE, J.C. Bose National Fellow, Padma Shri, S.S. Bhatnagar awardee, P.C. Mahalanobis National Award of the Ministry of Statistics and Program Implementation (MOSPI), Govt. of India, Editor-in-Chief of IEEE Transaction, Vice-President of Multinational IT Company, and Directors of premier national Institutes. Donations to Alma-maters and Instituting Medals/Fellowships to benefit the science & society: Besides his academic and research contributions, Pal has instituted the following awards in his alma-maters, starting from school education. These are aimed at nurturing the talent and scientific spirit as well as to help the students from less priviledged community, which in turn benefits the society: i) Two Merit-cum-Means Scholarships in 2013 for supporting two economically backward students of Classes IX and X every year in his alma-mater, Ariadaha Kalachand High School, Kolkata 700057, India. This facilitates them to complete their secondary school education. ii) A Gold Medal Award at Ramakrishna Mission Vivekanda Centenary College, Rahara, Kolkata 700118, India in 2024 for the Best Graduating BSc(Hons) Student across all science disciplines (currently seven) to nurture bright science-minds for higher studies. iii) A Gold Medal Award at Indian Statistical Institute (ISI), Kolkata 700108 in 2003 for the Best M.Tech.(Computer Science) Dissertation to encourage and promote research excellence. iv) Besides, he has been donating frequently to the Student Assistant Fund of Imperial College of Science & Technology, London, UK, his another Alma-mater, to help students who face hardship to complete their study Patriotism: NASA Johnson Space Center, Houston, TX, USA, desired to offer him a ""Green card"" in 1991 requesting to stay permanently in the USA when he was working there as a National Research Council (US National Academy of Sciences) Guest Investigator (Resident Research Associate). But he turned down the offer and returned back to India to serve his country for ever. Family: Sunity Kumar Pal (father), Parul Bala Pal (mother), Amita (wife), Dhiman & Anshuman (sons). He is the second child of his parents with brother: Samir, and sisters: Anuradha, Anurupa and Sutapa. He came from a very ordinary family with a low-income group and many members. He thereforte knows the kind of hurdles and hardship one has to face to complete the higher studies and reach the position where he is today. Message: It is not only the height at which you are flying is important, but  from which lower height you had taken off should also be of equal (if not more) concern.",0

Perlman,11,"As an undergraduate at MIT Perlman learned programming for a physics class. She was given her first paid job in 1971 as part-time programmer for the LOGO Lab at the (then) MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, programming system software such as debuggers. [14] Working under the supervision of Seymour Papert, she developed a child-friendly version of the educational robotics language LOGO, called TORTIS (""Toddler's Own Recursive Turtle Interpreter System""). During research performed in 1974–76, young children—the youngest aged 3½ years, programmed a LOGO educational robot called a Turtle. Perlman has been described as a pioneer of teaching young children computer programming.[15] Afterwards, she was inspired to make a new programming language that would teach much younger children similar to Logo, but using special ""keyboards"" and input devices. This project was abandoned because ""being the only woman around, I wanted to be taken seriously as a 'scientist' and was a little embarrassed that my project involved cute little kids"". MIT media project later tracked her down and told her that she started a new field called tangible user interface from the leftovers of her abandoned project. [16] As a math grad at MIT she needed to find an adviser for her thesis, and joined the MIT group at BBN Technologies. There she first got involved with designing network protocols.[17] Perlman obtained a B.S. and M.S. in Mathematics and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from MIT in 1988.[18]  Her doctoral thesis on routing in environments where malicious network failures are present serves as the basis for much of the work that now exists in this area. [2] When studying at MIT in the late 60s she was one among the 50 or so women students, in a class of about 1,000 students. To begin with MIT only had one women’s dorm, limiting the number of women students that could study. When the men’s dorms at MIT became coed Perlman moved out of the women’s dorm into a mixed dorm, where she became the ""resident female"". She later said that she was so used to the gender imbalance, that it became normal. Only when she saw other women students among a crowd of men she noticed that ""it kind of looked weird"".[19]",0

Before moving to Harvard University as Gordon McKay Professor of Computer Science in 1981, he was a professor at the Hebrew University.[3] In the late 1950s, he was invited for a summer to do research for IBM at the Lamb Estate in Westchester County, New York with other promising mathematicians and scientists. It was there that he and Dana Scott wrote the paper ""Finite Automata and Their Decision Problems"".[4] Soon, using nondeterministic automata, they were able to re-prove Kleene's result that finite state machines exactly accept regular languages.[1] As to the origins of what was to become computational complexity theory, the next summer Rabin returned to the Lamb Estate. John McCarthy posed a puzzle to him about spies, guards, and passwords, which Rabin studied and soon after he wrote an article, ""Degree of Difficulty of Computing a Function and Hierarchy of Recursive Sets.""[1][5] Nondeterministic machines have become a key concept in computational complexity theory, particularly with the description of the complexity classes P and NP. Rabin then returned to Jerusalem, researching logic, and working on the foundations of what would later be known as computer science. He was an associate professor and the head of the Institute of Mathematics at the Hebrew University at 29 years old, and a full professor by 33. Rabin recalls, ""There was absolutely no appreciation of the work on the issues of computing. Mathematicians did not recognize the emerging new field"".[1] In 1960, he was invited by Edward F. Moore to work at Bell Labs, where Rabin introduced probabilistic automata that employ coin tosses in order to decide which state transitions to take. He showed examples of regular languages that required a very large number of states, but for which you get an exponential reduction of the number of states with probabilistic automata.[1] In 1969, Rabin introduced  infinite-tree automata and proved that the  monadic second-order theory of n successors (S2S when n = 2) is decidable.[6] A key component of the proof implicitly showed determinacy of parity games, which lie in the third level of the Borel hierarchy. In 1975, Rabin finished his tenure as Rector of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and went to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the USA as a visiting professor. While there, Rabin invented the Miller–Rabin primality test, a randomized algorithm that can determine very quickly (but with a tiny probability of error) whether a number is prime.[7][8] Rabin's method was based on previous work of Gary Miller that solved the problem deterministically with the assumption that the generalized Riemann hypothesis is true, but Rabin's version of the test made no such assumption. Fast primality testing is key in the successful implementation of most public-key cryptography, and in 2003 Miller, Rabin, Robert M. Solovay, and Volker Strassen were given the Paris Kanellakis Award for their work on primality testing. In 1976 he was invited by Joseph Traub to meet at Carnegie Mellon University and presented the primality test. After he gave that lecture, Traub had said, ""No, no, this is revolutionary, and it's going to become very important.""[1] In 1979, Rabin invented the Rabin cryptosystem, the first asymmetric cryptosystem whose security was proved equivalent to the intractability of integer factorization.[9] In 1981, Rabin reinvented a weak variant of the technique of oblivious transfer invented by Wiesner under the name of multiplexing,[10] allowing a sender to transmit a message to a receiver where the receiver has some probability between 0 and 1 of learning the message, with the sender being unaware whether the receiver was able to do so. In 1987, Rabin, together with Richard Karp, created one of the most well-known efficient string search algorithms, the Rabin–Karp string search algorithm, known for its rolling hash.[11] Rabin's more recent research has concentrated on computer security. He is currently the Thomas J. Watson Sr. Professor of Computer Science at Harvard University and Professor of Computer Science at Hebrew University. During the spring semester of 2007, he was a visiting professor at Columbia University teaching Introduction to Cryptography.",67

Salton was perhaps most well known for developing the now widely used vector space model for Information Retrieval.[3]  In this model, both documents and queries are represented as vectors of term counts, and the similarity between a document and a query is given by the cosine between the term vector and the document vector.  In this paper, he also introduced TF-IDF, or term-frequency-inverse-document frequency, a model in which the score of a term in a document is the ratio of the number of terms in that document divided by the frequency of the number of documents in which that term occurs. (The concept of inverse document frequency, a measure of specificity, had been introduced in 1972 by Karen Sparck-Jones.[4]) Later in life, he became interested in automatic text summarization and analysis,[5] as well as automatic hypertext generation.[6]  He published over 150 research articles and 5 books during his life.",181

Simon attended Milwaukee Public Schools, where he developed an interest in science and established himself as an atheist. While attending middle school, Simon wrote a letter to ""the editor of the Milwaukee Journal defending the civil liberties of atheists"".[17] Unlike most children, Simon's family introduced him to the idea that human behavior could be studied scientifically; his mother's younger brother, Harold Merkel (1892–1922), who studied economics at the University of Wisconsin–Madison under John R. Commons, became one of his earliest influences. Through Harold's books on economics and psychology, Simon discovered social science. Among his earliest influences, Simon cited Norman Angell for his book The Great Illusion and Henry George for his book Progress and Poverty. While attending high school, Simon joined the debate team, where he argued ""from conviction, rather than cussedness"" in favor of George's single tax.[18] In 1933, Simon entered the University of Chicago, and, following his early influences, decided to study social science and mathematics. Simon was interested in studying biology but chose not to pursue the field because of his ""color-blindness and awkwardness in the laboratory"".[19] At an early age, Simon learned he was color blind and discovered the external world is not the same as the perceived world. While in college, Simon focused on political science and economics. Simon's most important mentor was Henry Schultz, an econometrician and mathematical economist.[1] Simon received both his B.A. (1936) and his Ph.D. (1943) in political science from the University of Chicago, where he studied under Harold Lasswell, Nicolas Rashevsky, Rudolf Carnap, Henry Schultz, and Charles Edward Merriam.[20] After enrolling in a course on ""Measuring Municipal Governments,"" Simon became a research assistant for Clarence Ridley, and the two co-authored Measuring Municipal Activities: A Survey of Suggested Criteria for Appraising Administration in 1938.[21] Simon's studies led him to the field of organizational decision-making, which became the subject of his doctoral dissertation.",0

He won a talent show in technological science for one of the first AI puzzle-solving PC computer simulations in 1986 before high school graduation gaining him early recognition. Starner graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with a B.S. in Brain and Cognitive Science (1991), a B.S. in Computer Science (1991), a M.S. in Media Arts and Science, and finally a Ph.D. in Media Arts and Sciences (1999) from the MIT Media Laboratory. His doctoral work was entitled ""Wearable Computing and Contextual Awareness,"" dealing with pattern recognition and how wearable computing can be utilized for purposes such as recognizing hand motions used in American Sign Language.[3][4][5] Starner is probably most well known for being a strong advocate for wearable computing. During his time at the MIT Media Lab, Starner, already responsible for helping create one of the earliest high-accuracy online cursive handwriting recognition systems in 1993[1][5] as an associate scientist with BBN's Speech Systems Group, became one of the world's leading experts on the subject. Starner is also a co-founder of the IEEE International Symposium on Wearable Computers (ISWC) and co-founder and first member of the MIT Wearable Computing Project, where he was one of the first 6 cyborgs involved.[1] Since 1993, Starner has been wearing his own customized wearable computer system full-time, arguably one of the longest, if not the longest, such instances. He designed the hardware for his system, dubbed ""The Lizzy"", based on designs of the wearable ""hip PC"" designed by Doug Platt, who built Starner's original wearable. The original system consisted of custom parts from a kit made by Park Enterprises, a Private Eye display, and a Twiddler chorded keyboard.[6][7][8] As of January 29, 2008, Starner's setup has evolved to include a heads-up display showing 640x480 screen resolution, a Twiddler, and an OQO Model 1 Ultra-Mobile PC (though the specifications listed suggest an OQO Model 01+) with a GHz processor, 512 MB of RAM, 30GB hard disk, USB2, Firewire, and Wi-Fi built in, as well as a mobile phone with cellular Internet access as well.[9] Some of the benefits he receives from wearing a computer include being able to type and access the Internet while walking around or talking to others, allowing him to take notes on a conversation in real-time, opening up notes on a certain subject and e-mailing them at any time or even having two conversations at once, one online and one face to face, and if he comes across something he doesn't know or recognize, he can instantly find out.[9] In addition to augmenting the outside world, having a computer on at all times improves Starner's nerves while giving talks; Starner has a speech impediment but is able to speak more clearly when prompted by a computer.[10] Starner is a Technical Lead/Manager on Google's Project Glass wearable computing project.[11] One of his prominent research focuses is the involvement of wearable computing with American Sign Language (ASL). His work intends to create a bridge between the deaf and hearing communities that will facilitate communication between the two using an ASL-to-English one-way translator. Starner is also researching dual-purpose speech, where a wearable computer will be able to interpret certain speech patterns and bring up appropriate programs, such as a calendar for scheduling appointments.[5][9][12] In addition, Starner has been involved in the Aware Home project, which uses technology to create an interactive and personalizable environment within the home that would benefit individuals who wouldn't normally be able to live independently.[13] Starner's preeminence in his field earned him a spot among Technology Review's TR100 top 100 remarkable innovators (now renamed TR35 and limited to thirty-five winners) in 1999.[2] His work has featured on CBS's 60 Minutes, CNN, BBC, and The Wall Street Journal and has been demonstrated to a number of Fortune 500 companies including Merrill Lynch, IBM, and Motorola.[1]",266

Bert Sutherland was his elder brother.[7] Ivan Sutherland earned his bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from the Carnegie Institute of Technology, his master's degree from Caltech, and his Ph.D. from MIT in Electrical Engineering in 1963.[8][2] Sutherland invented Sketchpad in 1962 while at MIT. Claude Shannon signed on to supervise Sutherland's computer drawing thesis.[2] Among others on his thesis committee were Marvin Minsky and Steven Coons. Sketchpad was an innovative program that influenced alternative forms of interaction with computers. Sketchpad could accept constraints and specified relationships among segments and arcs, including the diameter of arcs. It could draw both horizontal and vertical lines and combine them into figures and shapes. Figures could be copied, moved, rotated, or resized, retaining their basic properties. Sketchpad also had the first window-drawing program and clipping algorithm, which allowed zooming. Sketchpad ran on the Lincoln TX-2 computer and influenced Douglas Engelbart's oN-Line System. Sketchpad, in turn, was influenced by the conceptual Memex as envisioned by Vannevar Bush in his influential paper ""As We May Think"".[citation needed]",0

Turing,0,"Turing was born in Maida Vale, London, while his father, Julius Mathison Turing was on leave from his position with the Indian Civil Service (ICS) of the British Raj government at Chatrapur, then in the Madras Presidency and presently in Odisha state, in India.[16][17] Turing's father was the son of a clergyman, the Rev. John Robert Turing, from a Scottish family of merchants that had been based in the Netherlands and included a baronet. Turing's mother, Julius's wife, was Ethel Sara Turing (née Stoney), daughter of Edward Waller Stoney, chief engineer of the Madras Railways. The Stoneys were a Protestant Anglo-Irish gentry family from both County Tipperary and County Longford, while Ethel herself had spent much of her childhood in County Clare.[18] Julius and Ethel married on 1 October 1907 at Bartholomew's church on Clyde Road, in Dublin.[19] Julius's work with the ICS brought the family to British India, where his grandfather had been a general in the Bengal Army. However, both Julius and Ethel wanted their children to be brought up in Britain, so they moved to Maida Vale,[20] London, where Alan Turing was born on 23 June 1912, as recorded by a blue plaque on the outside of the house of his birth,[21][22] later the Colonnade Hotel.[16][23] Turing had an elder brother, John Ferrier Turing, father of Sir John Dermot Turing, 12th Baronet of the Turing baronets.[24] Turing's father's civil service commission was still active during Turing's childhood years, and his parents travelled between Hastings in the United Kingdom[25] and India, leaving their two sons to stay with a retired Army couple. At Hastings, Turing stayed at Baston Lodge, Upper Maze Hill, St Leonards-on-Sea, now marked with a blue plaque.[26] The plaque was unveiled on 23 June 2012, the centenary of Turing's birth.[27] Very early in life, Turing showed signs of the genius that he was later to display prominently.[28] His parents purchased a house in Guildford in 1927, and Turing lived there during school holidays. The location is also marked with a blue plaque.[29] Turing's parents enrolled him at St Michael's, a primary school at 20 Charles Road, St Leonards-on-Sea, from the age of six to nine. The headmistress recognised his talent, noting that she has ""...had clever boys and hardworking boys, but Alan is a genius"".[30] Between January 1922 and 1926, Turing was educated at Hazelhurst Preparatory School, an independent school in the village of Frant in Sussex (now East Sussex).[31] In 1926, at the age of 13, he went on to Sherborne School,[32] an independent boarding school in the market town of Sherborne in Dorset, where he boarded at Westcott House. The first day of term coincided with the 1926 General Strike, in Britain, but Turing was so determined to attend that he rode his bicycle unaccompanied 60 miles (97 km) from Southampton to Sherborne, stopping overnight at an inn.[33] Turing's natural inclination towards mathematics and science did not earn him respect from some of the teachers at Sherborne, whose definition of education placed more emphasis on the classics. His headmaster wrote to his parents: ""I hope he will not fall between two stools. If he is to stay at public school, he must aim at becoming educated. If he is to be solely a Scientific Specialist, he is wasting his time at a public school"".[34] Despite this, Turing continued to show remarkable ability in the studies he loved, solving advanced problems in 1927 without having studied even elementary calculus. In 1928, aged 16, Turing encountered Albert Einstein's work; not only did he grasp it, but it is possible that he managed to deduce Einstein's questioning of Newton's laws of motion from a text in which this was never made explicit.[35] At Sherborne, Turing formed a significant friendship with fellow pupil Christopher Collan Morcom (13 July 1911 – 13 February 1930),[36] who has been described as Turing's first love.[37][38][39] Their relationship provided inspiration in Turing's future endeavours, but it was cut short by Morcom's death, in February 1930, from complications of bovine tuberculosis, contracted after drinking infected cow's milk some years previously.[40][41][42] The event caused Turing great sorrow. He coped with his grief by working that much harder on the topics of science and mathematics that he had shared with Morcom. In a letter to Morcom's mother, Frances Isobel Morcom (née Swan), Turing wrote: I am sure I could not have found anywhere another companion so brilliant and yet so charming and unconceited. I regarded my interest in my work, and in such things as astronomy (to which he introduced me) as something to be shared with him and I think he felt a little the same about me ... I know I must put as much energy if not as much interest into my work as if he were alive, because that is what he would like me to do.[43] Turing's relationship with Morcom's mother continued long after Morcom's death, with her sending gifts to Turing, and him sending letters, typically on Morcom's birthday.[44] A day before the third anniversary of Morcom's death (13 February 1933), he wrote to Mrs. Morcom: I expect you will be thinking of Chris when this reaches you. I shall too, and this letter is just to tell you that I shall be thinking of Chris and of you tomorrow. I am sure that he is as happy now as he was when he was here. Your affectionate Alan.[45] Some have speculated that Morcom's death was the cause of Turing's atheism and materialism.[46] Apparently, at this point in his life he still believed in such concepts as a spirit, independent of the body and surviving death. In a later letter, also written to Morcom's mother, Turing wrote: Personally, I believe that spirit is really eternally connected with matter but certainly not by the same kind of body ... as regards the actual connection between spirit and body I consider that the body can hold on to a 'spirit', whilst the body is alive and awake the two are firmly connected. When the body is asleep I cannot guess what happens but when the body dies, the 'mechanism' of the body, holding the spirit is gone and the spirit finds a new body sooner or later, perhaps immediately.[47][48] After graduating from Sherborne, Turing applied for several Cambridge colleges scholarships, including Trinity and King's, eventually earning a £80 per annum scholarship (equivalent to about £4,300 as of 2023) to study at the latter.[49][50] There, Turing studied the undergraduate course in Schedule B (that is, a three-year Parts I and II, of the Mathematical Tripos, with extra courses at the end of the third year, as Part III only emerged as a separate degree in 1934) from February 1931 to November 1934 at King's College, Cambridge, where he was awarded first-class honours in mathematics. His dissertation, On the Gaussian error function, written during his senior year and delivered in November 1934 (with a deadline date of 6 December) proved a version of the central limit theorem. It was finally accepted on 16 March 1935. By spring of that same year, Turing started his master's course (Part III)—which he completed in 1937—and, at the same time, he published his first paper, a one-page article called Equivalence of left and right almost periodicity (sent on 23 April), featured in the tenth volume of the Journal of the London Mathematical Society.[51] Later that year, Turing was elected a Fellow of King's College on the strength of his dissertation.[52] However, and, unknown to Turing, this version of the theorem he proved in his paper, had already been proven, in 1922, by Jarl Waldemar Lindeberg. Despite this, the committee found Turing's methods original and so regarded the work worthy of consideration for the fellowship. Abram Besicovitch's report for the committee went so far as to say that if Turing's work had been published before Lindeberg's, it would have been ""an important event in the mathematical literature of that year"".[53][54][55] Between the springs of 1935 and 1936, at the same time as Church, Turing worked on the decidability of problems, starting from Godel's incompleteness theorems. In mid-April 1936, Turing sent Max Newman the first draft typescript of his investigations. That same month, Alonzo Church published his An Unsolvable Problem of Elementary Number Theory, with similar conclusions to Turing's then-yet unpublished work. Finally, on 28 May of that year, he finished and delivered his 36-page paper for publication called ""On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem"".[56] It was published in the Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society journal in two parts, the first on 30 November and the second on 23 December.[57] In this paper, Turing reformulated Kurt Gödel's 1931 results on the limits of proof and computation, replacing Gödel's universal arithmetic-based formal language with the formal and simple hypothetical devices that became known as Turing machines. The Entscheidungsproblem (decision problem) was originally posed by German mathematician David Hilbert in 1928. Turing proved that his ""universal computing machine"" would be capable of performing any conceivable mathematical computation if it were representable as an algorithm. He went on to prove that there was no solution to the decision problem by first showing that the halting problem for Turing machines is undecidable: it is not possible to decide algorithmically whether a Turing machine will ever halt. This paper has been called ""easily the most influential math paper in history"".[58] Although Turing's proof was published shortly after Alonzo Church's equivalent proof using his lambda calculus,[59] Turing's approach is considerably more accessible and intuitive than Church's.[60] It also included a notion of a 'Universal Machine' (now known as a universal Turing machine), with the idea that such a machine could perform the tasks of any other computation machine (as indeed could Church's lambda calculus). According to the Church–Turing thesis, Turing machines and the lambda calculus are capable of computing anything that is computable. John von Neumann acknowledged that the central concept of the modern computer was due to Turing's paper.[61] To this day, Turing machines are a central object of study in theory of computation.[62] From September 1936 to July 1938, Turing spent most of his time studying under Church at Princeton University,[4] in the second year as a Jane Eliza Procter Visiting Fellow. In addition to his purely mathematical work, he studied cryptology and also built three of four stages of an electro-mechanical binary multiplier.[63] In June 1938, he obtained his PhD from the Department of Mathematics at Princeton;[64] his dissertation, Systems of Logic Based on Ordinals,[65][66] introduced the concept of ordinal logic and the notion of relative computing, in which Turing machines are augmented with so-called oracles, allowing the study of problems that cannot be solved by Turing machines. John von Neumann wanted to hire him as his postdoctoral assistant, but he went back to the United Kingdom.[67]",0

The program could accept commands such as, ""Find a block which is taller than the one you are holding and put it into the box"" and carry out the requested action using a simulated block-moving  arm. The program could also respond verbally, for example, ""I do not know which block you mean.""

Zadeh,2,"Zadeh became the Chair of Department of Electrical Engineering at the University of California, Berkeley, in 1963. One of the lasting impacts of his leadership in this role is the expansion and the integration of computer science. He initiated and completed (in 1968) the transformation of the Electrical Engineering department at UC Berkeley to the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS). This strategic move not only led UC Berkeley's advancement into the top ranks of computer science education and research, but also led other research universities globally to add computer science to their electrical engineering departments. 
In 1973, Lotfi Zadeh received the prestigious (Institute of Electronic and Electrical Engineers) IEEE Education Award, largely in recognition of his performance as chair of EE and then EECS. Other important services to UC Berkeley include his Academic Senate committee memberships: Academic Planning & Resource Allocation (1992–95); Committees (1969–70; 1980–81); Courses of Instruction (1975–80); and Faculty Awards (1990–92). Professor Zadeh graduated more than 50 PhD students, many of whom went on to become leaders in various areas of engineering, management and information sciences.[30]",0

Zimmerman,0,"Zimmerman is from Naperville, Illinois.[2] While in high school in 1975, Zimmerman and her father built a computer with four kilobytes of memory after being inspired by the January cover story of Popular Mechanics by Ed Roberts on building your own computers. Zimmerman later remarked that it was this same article that inspired Bill Gates.[3][4][5] In 1981, Zimmerman earned a Bachelor of Science with distinction in Computer and Informational Sciences with a minor in Mathematics from Purdue University.[2] At graduation, she ranked among the top ten students in the School of Science and was a member of Phi Beta Kappa and Phi Kappa Phi. Upon enrolling in doctoral studies at the University of Minnesota Institute of Technology, Zimmerman was named a Corporate Associate Fellow.[6] In 1990, she earned a doctorate in computer science, specializing in computational and recursion theory.[7] Zimmerman completed her dissertation titled Classes of Grzegorczyk-Computable Real Numbers under her doctoral advisor Marian Pour-El.[2]",4
Zuckerberg,2,"Mark Elliot Zuckerberg was born on May 14, 1984, in  White Plains, New York to psychiatrist Karen (née Kempner) and dentist Edward Zuckerberg.[5] He and his three sisters (Arielle,  Randi, and  Donna) were raised in a Reform Jewish household[6] in Dobbs Ferry, New York.[7] His great-grandparents were Jewish emigrants from Austria, Germany, and Poland.[8] Zuckerberg initially attended Ardsley High School before transferring to Phillips Exeter Academy. He was captain of the fencing team.[9][10] Zuckerberg began using computers and writing software in middle school. In high school, he built a program that allowed all the computers between his house and his father's dental office to communicate with each other.[11][12] During Zuckerberg's high-school years, he worked to build a music player called the Synapse Media Player. The device used machine learning to learn the user's listening habits, which was posted to Slashdot[13] and received a rating of 3 out of 5 from PC Magazine.[14] The New Yorker once said of Zuckerberg: ""some kids played computer games. Mark created them.""[7] The New Yorker noted that by the time Zuckerberg began classes at Harvard in 2002, he had already achieved a ""reputation as a programming prodigy"". He studied psychology and computer science and belonged to Alpha Epsilon Pi and Kirkland House.[7][15] In his second year, he wrote a program that he called CourseMatch, which allowed users to make class selection decisions based on the choices of other students and help them form study groups. Later, he created a different program he initially called Facemash that let students select the best-looking person from a choice of photos. Arie Hasit, Zuckerberg's roommate at the time, explained: We had books called Face Books, which included the names and pictures of everyone who lived in the student dorms. At first, he built a site and placed two pictures or pictures of two males and two females. Visitors to the site had to choose who was ""hotter"" and according to the votes there would be a ranking.[16] The site went up over a weekend, but by Monday morning, the college shut it down, because its popularity had overwhelmed one of Harvard's network switches preventing students from accessing the Internet. In addition, many students complained that their photos were being used without permission. Zuckerberg apologized publicly, and the student paper ran articles stating that his site was ""completely improper"".[16]",5
Zuse,0,"Konrad Zuse was born in Berlin on 22 June 1910.[19] In 1912, his family moved to East Prussian Braunsberg (now Braniewo in Poland), where his father was a postal clerk. Zuse attended the Collegium Hosianum in Braunsberg, and in 1923, the family moved to Hoyerswerda, where he passed his Abitur in 1928, qualifying him to enter university.[citation needed] He enrolled in the Technical University of Berlin and explored both engineering and architecture, but found them boring. Zuse then pursued civil engineering, graduating in 1935.[19]",0
