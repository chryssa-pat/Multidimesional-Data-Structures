# Multidimesional_data_Structures

This project is about collecting and storing data about computer scientists in four different data structures (R-tree, Range-tree, Oc-tree, KD-tree). The user can search for scientists with a range search in the structure of their choice. The user can also search for the scientist that has a certain percentage of similarity in their Training Data using LSH.
